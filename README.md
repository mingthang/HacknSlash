# ⚔️ HacknSlash Project
This branch contains the version submitted by the deadline for the assigned internship position.

While the core systems are implemented, some features remain incomplete due to overlapping university commitments (exam and report weeks). I’ve prioritized clarity and structure, and I hope this version reflects the progress and potential of the project so far.

For continued updates and feature improvements, please refer to the **_update_** branch.
